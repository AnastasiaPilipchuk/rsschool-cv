## About Me
### I'm 23 years old.  I have been working as an accountant 3 years in the construction sector. My job has always involved working with numbers and attention to detail. Recently, I became interested in programming and decided to learn this field from scratch. Learning programming has become a new challenge and a way for me to grow. 
### In my free time, I enjoy cooking, yoga, sports, walking, traveling . I am always open to new knowledge and ready for new professional challenges!
